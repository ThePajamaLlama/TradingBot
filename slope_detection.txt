Use to create weighted multipliers for the amount of asset we want to purchase or sell.
Will be triggered after the short term EMA has crossed the longer SMA
Checks the change in price over time (slope of EMA vs SMA)
If slope grows rapidly then increase the amount we want to sell
If slope decreases rapidly then increase the amount we want to sell# (1)

slope0 = (x[n] - x[n-1])/(y[n] - y[n-1])
slope1 = (x[n-1] - x[n-2])/(y[n-1] - y[n-2])

    if slope0 - slope1 ~= 0, then there is either a sharp correction or the ema is flat (uncertain or low volatility, hold)

slope3 = (x[n-2] - x[n-3])/(y[n-2] - y[n-3])
if abs(slope2 - slope3) < small amount

(1) Check other parameters like stop losses or larger trend SMA before immediately dumping
    Maybe make the weight for sell orders 75% of that for buy orders
